### Background
> * Sales taxes makes up 33% of state tax revenue    

> * People try to avoid paying taxes when possible^\textcolor{blue}{[Citation needed]}^  

> * Online transactions have been effectively tax free  

> * Since 2008, states have started increasing enforcement of online sales tax collection

> * As of April 1, 2017, Amazon now collects sales tax in all states

### Growth of Amazon Tax Collection
![](../../code/5_figures/amazonCollection.png)


### Motivating Questions
* How responsive is consumer spending to sales taxes?

    + Do consumers shift spending away from Amazon when Amazon collects sales tax in their state?
    
    + If so, where do they shift their spending?
    
* Is consumer search behavior affected by sales taxes?
    
### Contribution to Literature
* **Cross-border Shopping**
    + Consumers living close to borders are more tax sensitive than those not close to borders
    + Mikesell (1970); Asplund, Friberg, and Wilander (2007); Davis (2011); Agarwal, Marwell, and McGranahan (2017)

* **Online Shopping**
    + Sales taxes influence individual's decisions of whether to shop online and how much they spend
    + Goolsbee (2000); Alm and Melnik (2005); Scanlan (2007); Ballard and Lee (2007); Einav et al (2014); Baugh, Ben-David, and Park (2017); Houde, Newberry, and Seim (2017)
    
* **Contributions**
    + Combine online shopping with cross-border shopping environments
    + Estimate substitution patterns between online and offline shopping
    + Examine effects on consumer search

### Preview of Results
**Amazon Effects**

* Consumers reduce their pre-tax Amazon spending by about -0.4% for each percent of sales tax Amazon collects
    + Effect is more pronounced for consumers zero-tax border counties
* Consumers increase their searching in response to any sales tax change

### Preview of Results
**Online Shopping Effects**

* In response to sales tax changes, consumers reduce their offline spending commensurate with the sales tax change, but increase their online spending by about twice the sales tax change
* Online spending is reduced when sales tax is collected online by about 0.8% per pp of sales tax

### Preview of Results
**Offline Shopping Effects**

* Offline competition and cross-border shopping is more important to consumers
* For every 1pp difference in sales tax rate between home and adjacent county rate, online-only spending drops by about 5%

### Data
* **comScore Web Behavior Database**
    + Captures computer-level browsing and transaction activity 
    + Households report various demographics and ZIP code
    + Includes domain name
    + Data from 2006 to 2016
    
### comScore

### Data
* **Nielsen Homescan Panel**
    + Nationally representative panel that keeps track of all goods that they buy and consume
    + High-quality data and well-maintained panel
    + Stores are anonymized, but they are categorized
    + Data from 2004-2015

### Nielsen

### Data
* **Tax Data Systems**
    + Database of state, county, and local sales tax rates at a ZIP code level
    + Data from 2006 to 2016

### Summary
* Consumers avoid taxes by shopping online
    + Online spending increases in response to sales tax increases
    
* Online spending is sensitive to sales taxes
    + Amazon spending is reduced by about 0.4% per percentage point of sales tax
    + Overall online spending is reduced by about 0.8% per percentage point of sales tax
    
* Offline shopping channels are more attractive than offline options
    + Tax differences between counties counteract online spending fully
    + Border counties are more sensitive to any tax changes


### Future Research
* Explore how this informs firm decisions and competitive responses
    + How does a firm's online and offline channels interact? Are they complements are substitutes?
    + How should a traditional retail firm respond to online-only retailers? 
    + How should retailers weigh competition between online-only retailers and nearby offline competition?
    + How does the online option affect firm entry/exit decisions?
