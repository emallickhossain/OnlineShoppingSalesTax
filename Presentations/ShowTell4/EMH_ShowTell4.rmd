### Progress Report
* Presented at the empirical lunch (and survived)
* Began doing some reduced-form analysis

### Presentation Debrief
* Presentation went decently well
    + Presented broad ideas of trying to relate online shopping to taxes and time use decisions 
    + Introduced question of using dataset to identify sales tax elasticities
    + Introduced dataset
* Overall, people liked the data and were proposing questions
* Liked some of my questions and agreed they were feasible in a reduced-form environment
* Less sure about my approach to creating a model that includes tax, time, and shopping decisions
    
### Reviewing Goolsbee (2000)
* Goolsbee (2000) estimates a probit model of the decision to purchase online after controlling for observables and sales taxes
* Dependent variable is 1 if person has **ever** purchased online and 0 otherwise
* Relies on a proprietary survey from December 1997 and only 20% of his sample had ever purchased anything online
* Estimated elasticity of online buying with respect to the tax price (1 + t) is about 2.3
    + Implies that applying sales tax to online purchases would reduce online shopping by about 24%
    
### Online Shopping Update

### Revisiting Goolsbee (2000)
* Online shopping has dramatically changed since December 1997
* Worth re-estimating Goolsbee's model with comScore data
    + Elasticities governing the decision of whether or not to purchase online has likely changed
    + Doubt that cracking down on Amazon has decreased online shopping by 24%
* Interesting to see how elasticities have changed over time
* comScore data is richer than Goolsbee's which allows for closer analysis of shopping behavior beyond the binary purchase decision

### Goals for Next Meeting
* Figure out what's going on with taxes
* Do reduced-form analysis incorporating the time dimension
    + Specifically incorporate state law changes that forced taxation of online sales (New York started in 2008)
    + Amazon crackdowns are nice natural experiments to do this
    + Could also use opening of Amazon Fulfillment Centers as well
