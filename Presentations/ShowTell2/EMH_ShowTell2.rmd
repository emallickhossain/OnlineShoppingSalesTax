### Progress Report
* Organized comScore online shopping and browsing data
    + Answered previous question about how online shopping and browsing activity has changed since 2002!
* Read papers linking online shopping with tax avoidance and increased elasticity
* Focused research question on online shopping and sales taxes and/or excise taxes for tobacco

### Question from Last Time
* How are panelists selected?
    + Primary source is through the Third-party Application Providers which offers free software, applications, and utilities in exchange for considering participating in the comScore panel
        * In many cases, people still receive the application even if they decline to join the panel
        * comScore also offers a Trees for Knowledge program which they pledge to plant a tree for each new panelist that joins
    + Second method is through their Affiliate program which relies on text or banner ads
        * People are encouraged through either "make your voice heard" appeals or incentives (see above)

### Number of Users in Sample

### Sales Summary
* Category 1 is Apparel. I'm sure this is some categorization fluke.

### Sales Summary
* Removing apparel, we see that Air Travel is the largest source of online sales

### Per Capita Sales
* We can also normalize this by the number of users that made online purchases, to make the numbers comparable across years

### Open Questions
* Are individuals shifting their offline shopping online or is this generating new shopping?
* Has online shopping become more concentrated over time (measured by number of sites visited or with recorded purchases)?
    + Seems like people are spending less time browsing and searching
* Does search in online shopping result in lower prices (i.e. what are the benefits of reduced search costs)?
* Is online shopping sensitive to sales or excise taxes?
    + Strong evidence from Goolsbee, et. al (2010) and Einav, et. al (2014)
* How should the observations be weighted? comScore only provides raw data, not weights.
    
### Goolsbee, Lovenheim, Slemrod (2010)
* Use cigarette sales, excise taxes, and internet penetration to estimate sensitive to taxes
    + Online tobacco merchants generally do not collect sales or excise taxes
* Find that internet sales have increased sensitivity of taxable cigarette sales to state tax rates by 69%
* Estimate that tax increases between 2001 and 2005 might have caused states to collect about 9% less revenue that would have been expected without tax-free internet sales

### Online Tobacco Sales
* What's going on here?
    + Not exactly sure just yet. Could be a categorization issue. Further investigation is under way.

### Goals for Next Meeting
* Clean comScore panelist data (i.e. remove panelists with missing or implausible data)
* Get data matching ZIP codes with states
* Get data of state-level sales and tobacco taxes since 2002
* Explore relationships between online sales and state sales tax (a la Einav, et. al 2014)
* Summarize more related papers
