### Progress Report
* Secured third-year paper readers (thanks Frank!)
* Obtained research data sets
    + comScore Web Behavior database
    + American Time-Use Survey
* Constructed exploratory analysis tool for time-use survey
* Beginning exploration of comScore data
    + Primary data for third-year paper
* Constructed short-list of feasible third-year paper questions

### Data Overview
* comScore Web Behavior Database
    + Records online browsing and transaction activity of about 50,000 US users
    + Years included: 2002, 2004, 2006-2015
    + Includes data on
        * Domains
        * Number of pages viewed within domain
        * Total time spent browsing domain
        * Product purchased
        * Product category
        * Price and quantity
        * Total price of basket

### Overview
* E-commerce is a hot topic of exploration in the IO literature and time-use 
data is shedding light on how people use the internet for shopping and leisure
* Many interesting questions in these areas:
    + How has online shopping and browsing activity (time and/or money spent) changed since 2002?
    + Are individuals shifting their offline shopping online or is this generating new shopping?
    + Has online shopping become more concentrated over time (measured by number of sites visited or with recorded purchases)?
    + Does search in online shopping result in lower prices (i.e. what are the benefits of reduced search costs)?
    + Is online shopping sensitive to sales or excise taxes?
    
### Time Spent Shopping
* According to the American Time Use Survey, time spent on consumer purchases has declined over time

# Related Literature
### Nevo and Wong (2015)
* Use Nielsen Homescan data to estimate the elasticity of 
substitution between time and market goods in home production
    + They obtain an estimate of 1.7 (SE = 0.5), which implies that households 
    will allocate more time to home production (i.e. cooking, coupon clipping, etc.) 
    if the relative price of market goods increases
    + They also document a decreasing opportunity cost of time over the Great Recession
    because households increased their shopping intensity even though the returns to
    shopping decreased over that period

### Aguiar and Hurst (2007)
* Use time-use data to estimate how foregone work hours 
were allocated during the Great Recession
    + They find that 50% of foregone work hours were allocated to leisure (primarily 
    sleeping and watching TV) and 30% were allocated to home production (primarily 
    cooking, cleaning, laundry, and shopping)
    
### Goolsbee, Lovenheim, Slemrod (2010)
* Use cigarette sales, excise taxes, and internet penetration to estimate sensitive to taxes
    + Online tobacco merchants generally do not collect sales or excise taxes
* Find that internet sales have increased sensitivity of taxable cigarette sales to state tax rates by 69%
* Estimate that tax increases between 2001 and 2005 might have caused states to collect about 9% less revenue that would have been expected without tax-free internet sales

### Goals for Next Meeting
* Review papers related to e-commerce to help narrow down feasible and interesting questions
* Clean and organize comScore data 
* Answer at least one of the questions posed earlier in this presentation
