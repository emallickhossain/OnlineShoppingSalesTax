### Progress Report
* Slow two weeks and did not get as much done as I aspired to last meeting
* Productively procrastinated and put together the time-use analysis [tool](http://mallickhossain.com/time-use/analysis/visualization/2017/02/14/time-use-analysis/) I teased about in the first meeting
* Summarized demographics of the comScore sample
* Took steps to secure Nielsen scanner data
    + Combining online and offline shopping behavior for the future
    + Probably not feasible to do this for third-year paper
    
# Demographics

### Race

### Race
* Compared to the 2014 racial breakdown of the US by the Census Bureau, the comScore sample is
    + Whiter, until 2010 (~80% vs 62% in Census)
    + Blacker, after 2010 (~20% vs 12% in Census)
    + Asian is relatively similar (5.2% in Census)
* I still have no idea how to treat Hispanic. Advice?

### Age

### Age
* Compared to the 2015 age distribution of the US, the comScore sample is more middle-aged (i.e. less 65+ and 25-44 year olds and that mass is in 45-64 year olds)

### Income

### Income
* Compared to the 2015 income distribution of the US, the comScore sample is slightly poorer
    + More making between $50k-$75k (~25% vs 17% in Census)
    + Less making over $100k (~15% vs 25% in Census)

### Question from Last Time
* What do the panelists look like?
    + Answered!
* What was going on with tobacco sales?
    + There was a categorization issue in 2002. New chart looks like this
* Are individuals shifting their offline shopping online or is this generating new shopping?
* Has online shopping become more concentrated over time (measured by number of sites visited or with recorded purchases)?
    + Seems like people are spending less time browsing and searching
* Does search in online shopping result in lower prices (i.e. what are the benefits of reduced search costs)?
* Is online shopping sensitive to sales or excise taxes?
    + Strong evidence from Goolsbee, et. al (2010) and Einav, et. al (2014)
* How should the observations be weighted? comScore only provides raw data, not weights.

### Goals for Next Meeting
* Clean comScore panelist data (i.e. remove panelists with missing or implausible data)
* Get data matching ZIP codes with states
* Get data of state-level sales and tobacco taxes since 2002
* Explore relationships between online sales and state sales tax (a la Einav, et. al 2014)
* Summarize more related papers
