I control for time variation in tax rates instead of just cross-sectional. Furthermore, their analysis primarily focuses on estimating a consumer response to a 7% price difference. In Singapore, VAT is 7% versus 0% in Malaysia. The effect of this could differ based on the degree (i.e. if the differential was only 1%, there might be no effect and the effect could be strongly discontinuous beyond a certain threshold)

This suffers from the same issue in that they are estimating the response to a severe discontinuity between a 0% tax rate and the normal tax rate (since they're looking at sales tax holidays).

Focuses on the 5pp difference in VAT in Mexico. That's it

Pretty good study utilizing variation in price levels and tax changes and as a result, they trace out a wide range of price differentials across different alcoholic beverages. No major criticism here except they don't look at online shopping

They address the extensive margin, which I do not, but they only look at cross-sectional variations in the tax rate. They also assume that the lowest state + local tax rate in the state since they only have information on the individual's state of residence (Scanlan brings this up as a shortcoming), but this is primarily an issue in states that allow for local tax variation

They take advantage of time changes in tax rates (there's not a lot between 1997 and 2001), but they only focus on the extensive margin for online purchases and they are looking at the early tail of online shopping which may not be the most informative for the current state of online retail. They do identify that there are 25 states that allow for different tax rates within the same city. I am not leveraging that variation just yet and I should.

Do not leverage the time dimension of sales tax or border effects. Also, primarily restrict to Amazon and do not control for different tax regimes across different websites.

 Do account for time variation in taxes, but only focus on eBay transactions, which might be a limiting subset.

Early internet shopping sample. Only looks at propensity to shop online and is a cross-section. No time element.
